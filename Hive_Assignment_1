#1. Download vechile sales data -> https://github.com/shashank-mishra219/Hive-Class/blob/main/sales_order_data.csv

#2. Store raw data into hdfs location
hadoop fs -put /sales_order_csv /tmp/hive_class/


#3. Create a internal hive table "sales_order_csv" which will store csv data sales_order_csv .. make sure to skip header row while creating table

Create table sales_order_csv
    (
    ORDERNUMBER int,
    QUANTITY_ORDERED INT,
    PRICE_EACH FLOAT,
    ORDER_LINE_NUMBER INT,
    SALES INT,
    STATUS STRING,
    QTR_ID INT,
    MONTH_ID INT,
    YEAR_ID INT,
    PRODUCT_LINE STRING,
    MSRP INT,
    PRODUCT_CODE STRING,
    PHONE STRING,
    CITY STRING,
    STATE STRING,
    POSTALCODE STRING,
    COUNTRY STRING,
    TERRITORY STRING,
    CONTACT_LASTNAME STRING,
    CONTACT_FIRSTNAME STRING,
    DEALSIZE STRING
    )
    ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
    FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
    TBLPROPERTIES("skip.header.line.count"="1");


#4. Load data from hdfs path into "sales_order_csv"

LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/tmp/hive_class/' INTO table sales_order_csv;

#5. Create an internal hive table which will store data in ORC format "sales_order_orc"

Create table sales_order_orc
    (
    ORDERNUMBER int,
    QUANTITY_ORDERED INT,
    PRICE_EACH FLOAT,
    ORDER_LINE_NUMBER INT,
    SALES INT,

    MONTH_ID INT,
    YEAR_ID INT,
    PRODUCT_LINE STRING,

    PRODUCT_CODE STRING,
    PHONE STRING,
    CITY STRING,
    STATE STRING,
    POSTALCODE STRING,
    COUNTRY STRING,
    TERRITORY STRING,
    CONTACT_LASTNAME STRING,
    CONTACT_FIRSTNAME STRING,
    DEALSIZE STRING
    )
    STORED AS ORC;


#6. Load data from "sales_order_csv" into "sales_order_orc"

INSERT INTO sales_order_orc Select * from  sales_order_csv;



#Perform below menioned queries on "sales_order_orc" table :

#a. Calculatye total sales per year

Select year_id , sum(sales) from sales_order_orc
group by year_id;

#b. Find a product for which maximum orders were placed

Select Product_line , count(ordernumber) as Total_Order from sales_order_orc
Group by Product_line
order by Total_Order desc
limit 1;

#c. Calculate the total sales for each quarter

Select QTR_ID , sum(Sales) as Total_Sales from sales_order_orc
Group by QTR_ID;

#d. In which quarter sales was minimum

select QTR_ID, sum(sales) as Total_Sales from sales_order_orc
Group by QTR_ID 
order by Total_Sales 
Limit 1;


#e. In which country sales was maximum and in which country sales was minimum



#f. Calculate quartelry sales for each city

select city , qtr_id , sum(sales) from sales_order_orc
group by city,qtr_id;



#h. Find a month for each year in which maximum number of quantities were sold

Select t1.*, row_number() over (partition by t1.year_id order by t1.Total_Qty desc) as rn
from
(Select month_id , year_id , sum(quantity_ordered) as Total_Qty from sales_order_orc
Group by  year_id,month_id) as t1
Where rn = 1;

#Note: both files are csv files. 


#1. Create a schema based on the given dataset
hadoop fs -mkdir /user/Hive_Data/AgentLogingReport/
hadoop fs -mkdir /user/Hive_Data/AgentPerformance/

hive> Create table Agent_Performance
    > (
    > SL_No int,
    > Date String,
    > Agent_Name String,
    > Total_Chats int,
    > Average_Responce_Time String,
    > Average_Resolution_Time String,
    > Average_Rating Float,
    > Total_Feedback int
    > )
    > Row Format Delimited
    > Fields Terminated by ','
    > TBLPROPERTIES("skip.header.line.count"="1");


hive> Create table Agent_Logging_Report
    > (
    > SL_No int,
    > Agent String,
    > Date String,
    > Login_Time String,
    > Logout_Time String,
    > Duration String
    > )
    > Row Format Delimited
    > Fields Terminated by ','
    > TBLPROPERTIES("skip.header.line.count"="1");



#2. Dump the data inside the hdfs in the given schema location.
hadoop fs -put AgentPerformance.csv /user/Hive_Data/AgentPerformance/
hadoop fs -put AgentLogingReport.csv /user/Hive_Data/AgentLogingReport/

#3. List of all agents' names.

Select Distinct Agent_Name from Agent_Performance;
 
#4. Find out agent average rating.

Select Agent_Name , AVG(Average_Rating) from Agent_Performance
Group by Agent_Name;


#5. Total working days for each agents

Select t1.Agent , count(t1.rn) as Total_Working_days
From
(
select Agent,to_date(from_unixtime(unix_timestamp(Date,'dd-MMM-yy'))) as Date,row_number() over (partition by
Agent) as rn from Agent_Logging_Report 
) as t1
Group by t1.Agent;

 
#6. Total query that each agent have taken 

Select Agent_Name ,sum(Total_Chats) as Total_Query from Agent_Performance
Group by Agent_Name;

#7. Total Feedback that each agent have received 

Select Agent_Name ,sum(Total_Feedback) as Total_Feedback from Agent_Performance
Group by Agent_Name;

#8. Agent name who have average rating between 3.5 to 4 

Select Distinct Agent_Name from Agent_Performance
Where Average_Rating Between 3.5 and 4.0;

#9. Agent name who have rating less than 3.5 

Select Distinct Agent_Name from Agent_Performance
Where Average_Rating < 3.5;

#10. Agent name who have rating more than 4.5 

Select Distinct Agent_Name from Agent_Performance
Where Average_Rating > 4.5;

#11. How many feedback agents have received more than 4.5 average

Select Agent_Name,Sum(Total_Feedback) as Total_Feedback from Agent_Performance
Where Average_Rating > 4.5
Group By Agent_Name;


#12. average weekly response time for each agent 



#13. average weekly resolution time for each agents 


#14. Find the number of chat on which they have received a feedback 




#15. Total contribution hour for each and every agents weekly basis 



#16. Perform inner join, left join and right join based on the agent column and after joining the table export that data into your local system.




#17. Perform partitioning on top of the agent column and then on top of that perform bucketing for each partitioning.

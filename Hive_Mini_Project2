#Objective - The assignment is meant for you to apply learnings of the module on Hive on a real-life dataset. One of the major objectives of this assignment is gaining familiarity with how an analysis works in Hive and how you can gain insights from large datasets.
 
#Problem Statement - New York City is a thriving metropolis and just like most other cities of similar size, one of the biggest problems its residents face is parking. The classic combination of a huge number of cars and a cramped geography is the exact recipe that leads to a large number of parking tickets.
 
#In an attempt to scientifically analyse this phenomenon, the NYC Police Department regularly collects data related to parking tickets. This data is made available by NYC Open Data portal. We will try and perform some analysis on this data.

#Download Dataset - https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?q=parking+tickets

#Note: Consider only the year 2017 for analysis and not the Fiscal year.

The analysis can be divided into two parts:
 
Part-I: Examine the data

#1.) Find the total number of tickets for the year.
select YEAR(from_unixtime(unix_timestamp(issue_date,'dd/mm/yyyy'),'yyyy-mm-dd')) , Count(Summons_Number)  from parking_voilation_orc where YEAR(from_unixtime(unix_timestamp(issue_date,'dd/mm/yyyy'),'yyyy-mm-dd')) = '2017' Group by 1;

#2.) Find out how many unique states the cars which got parking tickets came from.
Select Distinct(Registration_State) from parking_voilation_orc;


#3.) Some parking tickets don’t have addresses on them, which is cause for concern. Find out how many such tickets there are(i.e. tickets where either "Street Code 1" or "Street Code 2" or "Street Code 3" is empty )
Select Count(Summons_Number) from parking_voilation_orc where Street_Code1 = Null or Street_Code2 = Null or Street_Code3 = Null;


Part-II: Aggregation tasks

#1.) How often does each violation code occur? (frequency of violation codes - find the top 5)
Select Violation_Code , Count(Violation_Code) as cnt from parking_voilation_orc Group by 1 order by cnt desc limit 5;

#2.) How often does each vehicle body type get a parking ticket? How about the vehicle make? (find the top 5 for both)

SELECT vehicle_body_type, count(*) cnt
FROM parking_voilation_orc
GROUP BY vehicle_body_type
order by cnt desc limit 5;

SELECT vehicle_make, count(*) cnt
FROM parking_voilation_orc
GROUP BY vehicle_make
order by cnt desc limit 5;


#3.) A precinct is a police station that has a certain zone of the city under its command. Find the (5 highest) frequencies of:
      a.) Violating Precincts (this is the precinct of the zone where the violation occurred)

     select violation_precinct, count(*) from parking_voilation_orc
     group by violation_precinct;

      b.) Issuer Precincts (this is the precinct that issued the ticket)
     
     select issuer_precinct, count(*) from parking_voilation_orc
     group by issuer_precinct;

#4.) Find the violation code frequency across 3 precincts which have issued the most number of tickets - do these precinct zones have an exceptionally high frequency of certain violation codes?
with cte as
(
SELECT issuer_precinct,
violation_code,
count(violation_code) over (partition by issuer_precinct) cnt
FROM parking_voilation_orc
 
),
cte1 as
(
select issuer_precinct, cnt precinct_viol_count, violation_code, count(*) Cnt_violations
from cte 
group by issuer_precinct, cnt, violation_code
),
cte2 as
(
select 
issuer_precinct,violation_code,Cnt_violations, 
dense_rank() over(order by precinct_viol_count desc) rnk
from cte1
)
select issuer_precinct,violation_code,Cnt_violations from cte2
where rnk<=3
order by issuer_precinct, Cnt_violations desc


#5.) Find out the properties of parking violations across different times of the day: The Violation Time field is specified in a strange format. Find a way to make this into a time attribute that you can use to divide into groups.

Select date_format(from_unixtime(unix_timestamp(concat(issue_date,' ',concat(violation_time,'M')),'MM/dd/yyyy hhmmaa')), 'H') from parking_voilation;

#6.) Divide 24 hours into 6 equal discrete bins of time. The intervals you choose are at your discretion. For each of these groups, find the 3 most commonly occurring violations
with cte as 
(
select 
case 
 when cast(date_format(from_unixtime(unix_timestamp(concat(issue_date,' ',concat(violation_time,'M')),'MM/dd/yyyy hhmmaa')), 'H') as int) between 0 and 3 then '1st (0-3)'
 when cast(date_format(from_unixtime(unix_timestamp(concat(issue_date,' ',concat(violation_time,'M')),'MM/dd/yyyy hhmmaa')), 'H') as int) between 4 and 7 then '2nd (4-7)'
 when cast(date_format(from_unixtime(unix_timestamp(concat(issue_date,' ',concat(violation_time,'M')),'MM/dd/yyyy hhmmaa')), 'H') as int) between 8 and 11 then '3rd (8-11)'
 when cast(date_format(from_unixtime(unix_timestamp(concat(issue_date,' ',concat(violation_time,'M')),'MM/dd/yyyy hhmmaa')), 'H') as int) between 12 and 15 then '4th (12-15)'
 when cast(date_format(from_unixtime(unix_timestamp(concat(issue_date,' ',concat(violation_time,'M')),'MM/dd/yyyy hhmmaa')), 'H') as int) between 16 and 19 then '5th (16-19)'
 when cast(date_format(from_unixtime(unix_timestamp(concat(issue_date,' ',concat(violation_time,'M')),'MM/dd/yyyy hhmmaa')), 'H') as int) between 20 and 23 then '6th (20-23)'
end time_group,
violation_code
from 
parking_voilation_orc
),
cte1 as 
(
select
time_group,
violation_code,
count(*) violations
from cte
group by time_group,
violation_code),
cte2 as 
(
select time_group, violation_code, violations,
dense_rank() over (partition by time_group order by violations desc) rnk
from cte1
)
select time_group, violation_code, violations  from cte2
where rnk <=3



#7.) Now, try another direction. For the 3 most commonly occurring violation codes, find the most common times of day (in terms of the bins from the previous part)
with cte as
(
select 
case 
 when cast(date_format(from_unixtime(unix_timestamp(concat(issue_date,' ',concat(violation_time,'M')),'MM/dd/yyyy hhmmaa')), 'H') as int) between 0 and 3 then '1st (0-3)'
 when cast(date_format(from_unixtime(unix_timestamp(concat(issue_date,' ',concat(violation_time,'M')),'MM/dd/yyyy hhmmaa')), 'H') as int) between 4 and 7 then '2nd (4-7)'
 when cast(date_format(from_unixtime(unix_timestamp(concat(issue_date,' ',concat(violation_time,'M')),'MM/dd/yyyy hhmmaa')), 'H') as int) between 8 and 11 then '3rd (8-11)'
 when cast(date_format(from_unixtime(unix_timestamp(concat(issue_date,' ',concat(violation_time,'M')),'MM/dd/yyyy hhmmaa')), 'H') as int) between 12 and 15 then '4th (12-15)'
 when cast(date_format(from_unixtime(unix_timestamp(concat(issue_date,' ',concat(violation_time,'M')),'MM/dd/yyyy hhmmaa')), 'H') as int) between 16 and 19 then '5th (16-19)'
 when cast(date_format(from_unixtime(unix_timestamp(concat(issue_date,' ',concat(violation_time,'M')),'MM/dd/yyyy hhmmaa')), 'H') as int) between 20 and 23 then '6th (20-23)'
end time_group,
violation_code,
count(violation_code) over (partition by violation_code) violations
from 
parking_voilation_orc
),
cte1 as
(
select 
*,
dense_rank() over (order by violations desc) most_viol_rnk

from cte 
)
select violation_code, time_group, violations Total_Viol_under_code, 
count(time_group) Total_Vio_under_timegroup
from cte1 
where most_viol_rnk<=3
group by violation_code, time_group, violations
order by violation_code, Total_Vio_under_timegroup desc

#8.) Let’s try and find some seasonality in this data
      a.) First, divide the year into some number of seasons, and find frequencies of tickets for each season. (Hint: A quick Google search reveals the following seasons in NYC: Spring(March, April, March); Summer(June, July, August); Fall(September, October, November); Winter(December, January, February))
      b.)Then, find the 3 most common violations for each of these seasons.

with cte as 
(
select 
case 
 when MONTH(from_unixtime(unix_timestamp(issue_date,'dd/mm/yyyy'),'yyyy-mm-dd')) between 03 and 05 then 'Spring'
 when MONTH(from_unixtime(unix_timestamp(issue_date,'dd/mm/yyyy'),'yyyy-mm-dd')) between 06 and 08 then 'Summer'
 when MONTH(from_unixtime(unix_timestamp(issue_date,'dd/mm/yyyy'),'yyyy-mm-dd')) between 09 and 11  then 'Fall'
 when MONTH(from_unixtime(unix_timestamp(issue_date,'dd/mm/yyyy'),'yyyy-mm-dd')) in (1,2,12) then 'Winter'
end season,
violation_code
from 
parking_voilation
),
cte2 as 
(
select season, violation_code,
count(*) violatons_per_season_per_code
from cte
group by season, violation_code
),
cte3 as (
select season, violation_code,
dense_rank() over(partition by season order by violatons_per_season_per_code desc) rnk
from cte2
)
select season, violation_code from cte3
where rnk<=3;
